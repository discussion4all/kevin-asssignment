1) Explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface.

Answer:

Interfaces only describe what properties and methods should be implemented, and donâ€™t describe how methods should work.

For example: 
interface MyInterface {
   method_1(): void;
   method_2(): string;
}


Abstract classe is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects. to access it, it must be inherited from another class.

For example:
abstract class Fruits {
  
  public void apple() {
    -------
  }
}

class Foods extends Fruits {
	-------
}
 

2) What is the purpose of getters and setters in a class?

Answer:

The Getter and Setter are two conventional methods that are used for retrieving and updating value of a variable. We can not get/set private variable value outside the class so we need Getter and Setter method to do it. 

For example:
let user = {
  // Getter method
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  
  // Setter method
  set name(value) {
    this._name = value;
  }
};

user.name = "Pete";
alert(user.name); // Pete
